## Installation

Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/idlerberg/Bootstrap-Directory-Lister` or use the [`Download ZIP`](https://github.com/idleberg/Bootstrap-Directory-Lister/archive/master.zip) option. Make sure to make `_bs-index.php` the directory index in your `.htaccess` file (see included example)

## Usage

You can configure the optional columns (size, age, permissions), column sorting, and the list of ignored file names in in the header of the script file. If you prefer a different file name for the script, make sure to change it along the `DirectoryIndex` and add it to the ignore list.
